# Potter checkbox

A schoolproject with HTML/CSS/JS. A useless site that somehow ended up with a Harry Potter theme...

Besides from the standard requierments for the assignment I have also added som animations and a connection to a API.

# Code Review

1. `script.js: 15-16` - Very good work within the code. My only feedback is to try to name your functions and variables in a more descriptive manner. It’s difficult to understand for example what “sepellInst” and “yourName” refers to.
2. After I’ve written my first spell, the descriptive text only shows for a brief moment when you click on the input-field again, and as a user, you don’t have time to read that text in order to try the other spells. It’s good that the checkbox-option exists, but it would be nice if that text didn’t fade away so quickly.
3. When the user clicks on the checkboxes, a text below will show if it’s “Engorgio” or “Wingardium Leviosa”, but not “Fidelius”, which makes the user confused as to why boxes are disappearing if they’re not familiar with the world of Harry Potter.
4. Personally, I had a hard time understanding that the website had quotes. To me, the quotes containers with its red background looked like warning alert boxes, which was confusing. Maybe you can try a different styling or add quotation marks?
5. I would suggest adding an arrow or some kind of incentive to make the user scroll down the long list of character-names! I didn’t understand that there was something else down there the first times I tried the website.
